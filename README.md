### Quick Start
1. Import "HoloKitSDK" folder under "Assets" folder into a new Unity project.
2. Open the example scene "HoloKitSDK/Examples/HoloKitSample_ARKit".
3. Build your scene and run! This scene can run on both iOS and Android.
4. After the app runs, you should see a cube floating in the air somewhere. You may gaze at the sphere.
5. The app detects planes, and you may click on the screen to place the cube on the plane.
6. You may touch the small "AR/MR" button to switch to HoloKit mode.

### Create your own experience
1. Create a new scene in Unity.
2. Drag and drop everything in "HoloKitSDK/Prefabs/Universal" to the scene.
3. Put anything you like under "HoloKitPlacementRoot", and your model should have a comparable size as "DebugCube". Then feel free to turn off or delete "DebugCube".
4. Build your scene and run!
5. If you don't like the ambient light, please disable HoloKitAmbientLight in your scene.

## Reference
### Prefabs
#### HoloKitCamera
* The most basic component to have your game responds to ARKit tracking.
* It has a child VideoSeeThroughCamera that renders video seethrough VR experience. There are two extra cameras "Left Eye", "Right Eye" as its children, to render stereo for HoloKit. In "HoloKitCameraRig" object, you can set default see through mode and the key for toggling modes.

#### HoloKitObjectGenerator

##### DisplayPlanes
* To generate collidable planes when ARKit detects a plane. Optionally, you can set a Plane Prefab as its property to visualize the generated planes.

##### PointCloud
* To visualize point clouds that ARKit detects, for debugging purpose.

##### AmbientLight
* A directional light, which intensity is controlled by ARKit. The intensity will adjust automatically based on the current environment's lighting in reality.

##### HoloKitPlacementRoot
* A convenient prefab to help you place your objects on the ground. See "How to place your object on the ground" for details.

#### HoloKitGazeManager
* A convenient prefab for you to emit gaze events. See "How to respond to gaze events" for details.

### How to place your object on the ground
1. Drag "HoloKitPlaneGenerator" and "HoloKitPlacementRoot" to your scene.
2. Put your object under "HoloKitPlacementRoot", and your object should have a comparable size as "DebugCube". Then feel free to turn off or delete "DebugCube".
